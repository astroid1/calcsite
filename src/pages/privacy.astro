    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      We built Click Calculations so you can run numbers without creating an account. This policy explains what limited
      information is collected, why we collect it, and the choices you have over your data.

  <nav class="card info-card" aria-label="Privacy overview">
    <h2>Quick summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No calculator inputs are stored on our servers—everything happens in your browser.</li>
      <li>We receive anonymous analytics and advertising data from trusted partners to keep the site running.</li>
      <li>You can control cookies and personalised ads through your browser or the AdChoices program.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="information-we-collect" class="card info-card">
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to collect as little personal information as possible. The data we do receive falls into the following
      categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage information:</strong> Anonymous metrics such as page views, device type, approximate region, and
        referral source help us understand which calculators are most useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cookie data:</strong> Small text files may remember preferences (for example, a currency or location you
        used in a calculator) so the interface opens faster next time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advertising data:</strong> Google AdSense may place its own cookies or use mobile identifiers to deliver
        and measure ads. These identifiers are controlled by Google and never reveal your name or contact details to us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Affiliate tracking:</strong> Some outbound links contain partner codes so we can receive credit for
        referrals. Partners provide aggregate reports without personal identifiers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="how-we-use-data" class="card info-card">
    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use the limited information available to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate, maintain, and improve calculators and supporting infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Measure the effectiveness of features so we can prioritise updates.</li>
      <li>Display relevant ads, detect fraud, and comply with advertising policies.</li>
      <li>Respond to questions you send us directly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for their own marketing
      purposes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="cookies" class="card info-card">
    <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies and local storage help the site remember lightweight preferences such as the theme of a widget. You can
      clear or block these through your browser settings, although some calculators may default to generic values as a
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      For personalised advertising, Google may set cookies or use mobile identifiers. You can opt out of personalised ads
      by visiting
      <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ad Settings</a> or the
      <a href="https://youradchoices.com/control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdChoices</a> programme.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="data-retention" class="card info-card">
    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Calculator inputs are calculated locally and are cleared when you refresh or close your browser tab. Analytics and
      advertising partners retain aggregated logs for their standard retention periods (generally between 26 and 38
      months) so they can report on trends and prevent abuse.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="third-parties" class="card info-card">
    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>We rely on carefully selected partners to deliver parts of the experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google AdSense:</strong> Provides advertising and related metrics. Review
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's ad
        policies</a> for details on how they use cookies and data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics services:</strong> We may use privacy-focused analytics tools that aggregate usage without
        storing personally identifiable information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Affiliate partners:</strong> Retailers or service providers may know you visited through our referral
        link, but they do not share your contact information with us.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These partners operate under their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them if you have questions about
      how your data is handled outside of Click Calculations.
